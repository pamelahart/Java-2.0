    Loops-
    - for loop
    - while loop
    - for in = for objects uses () to put your object info in
    - for each = for arrays uses [] with commas to seperate
    
    Parameters for a For loop 1. start point 2. how far to go numerically 3. Repitions  4 main types of loops

    while loops can run forever! IT WILL CRASH THE MACHINE!! its deconstructed w/ everything in the ( ) has variables that are either true or false. If you don't answer the end point, it will loop forever.

    for in loops allow you to adjust each parameter that makes up the loop,
    its size, its color, its weight for example. You must set the var to an object, then define the object.

    for each allows you to alter any item in the array

    Make a p5.js sketch that uses loops to iteratively draw to the screen.
Play around with changing values in your loops until you've found an interesting or unexpected image.
While you're making your sketch, think about how iteration is a core concept of computation. How is that concept evident
in digital images?
Be sure to discuss what you made:

What are the tricky parts about using loops in JavaScript?
Did you encounter any infamous browser crashing infinite loops?
What are other things you could make using loops?
We have used loops before. This assignment differs from those previous exercises by having the goal to experiment with
the the "repeat" concept from Form and Code, and to practice using loops in javascript. -->
