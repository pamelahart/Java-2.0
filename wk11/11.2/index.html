<!-- Make a p5.js sketch that uses loops to iteratively draw to the screen.
Play around with changing values in your loops until you've found an interesting or unexpected image.
While you're making your sketch, think about how iteration is a core concept of computation. How is that concept evident
in digital images?
Be sure to discuss what you made:

What are the tricky parts about using loops in JavaScript?
Did you encounter any infamous browser crashing infinite loops?
What are other things you could make using loops?
We have used loops before. This assignment differs from those previous exercises by having the goal to experiment with
the the "repeat" concept from Form and Code, and to practice using loops in javascript. -->
