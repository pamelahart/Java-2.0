/* This assignment will allow to apply some of the themes from Form and Code to real programs.

Choose a theme proposed in Form and Code(Repeat Transform Parameterize Visualize or Simulate).
    Make 3 distinct p5.js sketches that attempt to showcase that theme.
When you're making the sketches, add in your index.html page an <h1> tag that displays which theme you are working on.  
In your post be sure to discuss your creation:

Which theme did you pick ? Why ? What drew you to that theme in particular ?
    What p5.js tools did you use to make that theme happen ?
        If you had more time, what else would you make ?
            Here is an example.  (Links to an external site.)I chose to work with the "Transform" theme because I'm interested in learning about how I can take an existing form and alter it. Note that this is a pretty basic example, your assignment should try to push things a little further.  

TURN IT IN
Build the sketch on your local computer.
Commit your sketch to Github
Upload it to your mcad server.
Post links to your MCAD url and Github repo here. */
